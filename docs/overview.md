# Overview

Welcome to Visual Chronicle. This is a mock API service that simulates REST interface for an imaginary cloud-hosted tool that allows users to log movies they've seen. Subscribers can register users, post movies, and add log dates. This page provides an overview of some of the tool's features, as well as some quickstart ideas.

## Key Features

- **Movie Archive:** Post, update, and retrieve movies to the database.
- **User Database:** Enroll new users, update user information, or search users.
- **Watch History:** Log movies based on time, format, and user.
